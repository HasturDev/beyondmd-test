## Usage Instructions

In order to use this file, you must execute the appropriate command for your system:

- For Windows systems, go to https://nodejs.org/ and https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/ in order to install the required packages.
If you don't know whether or not you have the required installations just use:
```
./start/start.bat
```
and the file will check for you. This is a work in progress and might not tell you if the proper npm packages are installed

- For Debian/Ubuntu systems, use:
```
source start/start.sh
```

Once this is done, the code will check your system for the appropriate packages, libraries, and software. If they are not present, it will attempt to install them.
